# Search Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of various search algorithms in Python, primarily for AI and pathfinding problems. The code is kept simple and educational, suitable for students and developers who are learning about search strategies.

## Repository Structure
Each Python file demonstrates a specific algorithm with a small graph or grid example for clarity.

### Implemented Algorithms

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
- **DLS (Depth-Limited Search)**
- **IDS (Iterative Deepening Search)**
- **Uniform Cost Search**
- **Greedy Best-First Search**
- **A\* Search (Graph and Grid versions)**
- **IDA\* Search (Iterative Deepening A\*)**
- **Hill Climbing (Graph and Grid versions)**

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/search-algorithms-python.git
cd search-algorithms-python
```

Run any algorithm:

```bash
python bfs.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required except standard modules (`heapq`, `collections`)

## Usage
These scripts are intended for educational use. You can modify the example graphs or grids to test different scenarios.
